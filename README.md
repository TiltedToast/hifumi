export const credentials = {
    token: "YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN ",
    clientId: "THE CLIENT ID OF YOUR BOT",
    exchangeApiKey: "API KEY FOR https://www.exchangerate-api.com/",
    imgurClientId: "IMGUR APP CLIENT ID",
    imgurClientSecret: "IMGUR APP CLIENT SECRET",

    redditClientSecret: "REDDIT APP CLIENT SECRET",
    redditRefreshToken: "REDDIT APP REFRESH TOKEN",
